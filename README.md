Add old season data (Season 1 done: minus Lance and Josh) - Min games is wrong

Other:

Mobile tabs solution
Gambling currency (Place a bet, next time that matchup happens check if bet won)( Odds are All-Time difference in TNSR between players)
Scroll through old games (maybe pagination)
Emoji support
Implement Elo
Run the numbers doesn't work if season is empty
New rule suggestions and votes (show who voted but not for what)
Remove / Edit comment or game (that you added)
FAQ / Rules list
Wins to #1 and +1 aren't taking into account the extra wins discounting unplayed losses
If only one player has >1 unplayed, don't punish the others for that one game
Colours for TNSR, wins to #1, etc (10 diff colours, colour users cell based on which percentile group they're in)
All time stats/records pages for league and user
All time league table (ignores penalty)
Max games vs one player - 10 seems reasonable?
